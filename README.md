# Node.js-SocketPaint
A web page that allows many users to draw in the same field while coloring cells.

In this project I used Node.js as server side software in combination with express module and Socket.io

When you connect a new user who has to choose a nickname, everyone else is notified of the new user's connection.

Also, information about the action of each user is constantly displayed (which cell was painted)
